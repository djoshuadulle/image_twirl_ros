# Modify Orientation
# flip_x - flip the image around the x-axis (vertical flipping)
# flip_y - flip around the y-axis (horizontal flipping)
# flip_xy - flip around both axes

# Modify Color
# bgr2hsv - Switch to hue, saturation, value color mode.
# bgr2gray - Converting the image to grayscale.

# Image Smoothing
# blur - Smoothing that softens edges.
# gaussianBlur - Gaussian filtering is highly effective in removing noise from image.
# bilateralFilter - Smoothing without removing edges.

# Brightness and Contrast
# brightness -  measure of luminous intensity
# contrast - amount of color differentiation that exists between various image features
